### Growth

Growth is broken into Growth Sets, Groups, and Actions.

- Growth Directions: When NOT using sets, the Growth Directions tell the player how many growth groups to pick (usually, Pick One or Pick Two). When using Sets, these instructions are instead added to the set.
- "Use Growth Sets"/"Stop Using Growth Sets" button:
  - "Use Growth Sets" button: Adds Growth Sets to the interface. All current Growth Groups are automatically added to the first Set.
  - "Stop Using Growth Sets" button: Switches back to not using Growth Sets. All Growth Groups & Actions are preserved.
- **Growth Sets** are *optional* and used for Growth on spirits such as Lure and Spread of Rampant Green, where the player has two sets to choose from.
  - Growth Set Choice: This field contains instructions for the Growth Set, such as 'Pick one of' or 'Always'.
  - "Add Growth Set" button: Adds additional Growth Sets.
  - **X** button: Deletes the current Growth Set and all of its Growth Groups and Actions
- **Growth Groups** are clusters of Growth Actions. During Growth, the player typically chooses a Growth Group and then does the Growth Actions in that Group.
  - Add Cost: Optional. Allows for an energy cost associated with this group (as seen on Keeper).
    - Non-Energy Scaling Costs: Optional. Try '1,dahan' or '1,custom1' or other icon names
    - Custom Costs: Optional. Try "forget-power-card,Cost: Forget a Power Card from Discard"
  - Add Tint: Optional. Allows a color shift on growth options (as seen on Spread of Rampant Green).
  - Add Title: Optional. Allows for a title over a single growth option (see Ember-Eyed). NOTE use 'Growth Sets' for a Lure-type subtitle.
  - Add Growth Group: Adds an additional Growth Group.
  - **X**: Deletes the current Growth Group & all of its Growth Actions
- **Growth Actions** are the individual growth actions, such as gaining energy or adding a presence. How to write these actions are detailed below.

### Presence Tracks

The two presence tracks (energy & plays) are filled out here. To accomplish middle nodes (such as Serpent or Finder), wrap the **energy** node in 'middle()'.

- Node boxes: Each text box represents the effect of one node. See 'Supported Presence Track Options'. In most cases, icon brackets {} are NOT needed in Presence Track nodes (custom is the exception).
  - Node boxes automatically update when you click/tab/enter away from the node.
- + Button: Adds a node between the two nodes.
- x Button: Removes the node.
- Note: This will appear at the top of the Presence track box, as seen on Finder. Use [{icon shortcuts}](#general-icons) here.

### Innate Powers

- Power Name: The name of the Innate Power
- Remove Innate Power: Permanently deletes the Innate Power
- Fast/Slow: Toggles the Speed of the Power
- Range: The range of the innate. Uses special syntax:
  - For a power without range (such as Spirit targeting powers), type "none" or leave the range blank.
  - For range, use an icon (if needed) + an integer separated by a comma. Examples:
    - 0
    - 1
    - sacred-site,2
    - wetland-presence,1
- Target: The target of the innate. Unlike Range, this uses the same HTML code as the rest of the template, so you can use any icons and the shorthand syntax (ie. {dahan}).
  - "No" target: You can add {no-} before any icon to put a red X over it ({no-blight}). For text, use {no} (ie. {no}Invaders).
- Target Land/Target: Toggle between Target Land (for land targetting powers) and Target (for Powers that target spirits, etc).
- Note (optional): Allows adding notes to the top of the innate (See Volcano Looming High or Lure of the Deep Wilderness as an example). Use [{icon shortcuts}](#general-icons) here (such as {dahan}).
- Add Level: Adds a Thershold Level to the Innate Power.
  - Threshold: Contains the threshold informatioin. Can include:
    - Elements: 1-plant,2-fire
    - Icons: 2-wilds
    - Energy Costs: cost-2
      - Example: Volcano: 3-fire,cost-2 or Many Minds: 1-air,2-animal,2-beasts
    - Other Cost w/ custom icon: cost(custom1)-1 or cost(dahan)-2. Icon will appear with '-x' where x is the number you use.
      - Example: Spreading Rot: 2-moon,3-water,2-animal,2-cost(custom1)
    - Or: As seen on Trickster
      - Example: Trickster: 3-sun,OR,3-fire
    - Custom Text: You can use text in place of an icon in a threshold
      - Example: 2-water,2-text(X)
- Long: Allows the level text to spill into the second column (like Volcano's first Innate Power, last threshold). Use only when appropriate.
- Effect: The effect of the power at that threshold level. Use {icons} freely here.
  - To achieve 'for each element' effects, use the notation {element, #}.
  - Example: Serpent's Second Innate, Second Level: For each **_{moon,2} {earth,2}_**, 2 {fear} and push 1 {town}.
- Add Innate Power: Adds another Innate Power. You can add more than 2... but it won't be pretty so don't do it.
