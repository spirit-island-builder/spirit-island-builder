# Google Drive API Configuration.
# Get these from Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/

# Create a new project in Google Cloud Console e.g. "Spirit Island Builder".

# Go to APIs & Services > Library.
# Enable the "Google Drive API" for your project.

# Go to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen. And click on "First Steps".
# Enter the Application name (e.g. "Spirit Island Builder") as well as the support email.
# Use External and provide a contact email.
# Accept the scopes and save.

# Go to APIs & Services > Credentials, click Create Credentials → OAuth client ID.
# Choose Web application, add authorized JavaScript origins (e.g. https://www.spiritislandbuilder.com).
# Add authorized redirect URIs (e.g. https://www.spiritislandbuilder.com).
# Copy the client ID → put into VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID.

# Go to APIs & Services > Credentials, click Create Credentials → API key.
# Restrict by HTTP referrer → add URL (e.g. https://www.spiritislandbuilder.com/*).
# Restrict API usage → only allow Google Drive API.
# Copy the key → put into VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY.

# When you’re ready for real users, go to OAuth consent screen and publish the app.
# It may take a few hours until the app is verified and you can remove the "unverified" warning.
# Up to 100 users can still use it without full verification.

# If you want unlimited users and no scary warning screen, request verification:
# Go to OAuth Consent Screen → click Submit for verification.
# You’ll need to provide:
# App domain (e.g. https://www.spiritislandbuilder.com).
# Privacy Policy URL (must be publicly accessible).
# Terms of Service URL (optional, but recommended).
